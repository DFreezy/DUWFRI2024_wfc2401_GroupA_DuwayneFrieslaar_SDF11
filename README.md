Hi. My name is Duwayne Frieslaar. I am a Codespace student, and I have created this landing page. Doing this challenge really introduced new adventures that I didn't know my mind could go on. I did experience some challenges along the way, such as getting the nav bar to work, but with a little help, I did it.

Doing this challenge made me want to get into doing this kind of thing a lot more now, because of how I could potentially learn more and expand my knowledge. I would like to do this from scratch on my own at some point in time. 

My goal was to make this landing page as engaging as possible. I hope who ever makes use of this would greatly benefit from it.
